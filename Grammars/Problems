 > "is it true that every pickle worked on __he__ ?"
 ** Solved by adding the NP'

 > Very few sentences with present progressive
 ** Solved by changing weight

 > "I kissed every sandwich __that__ a delicious pickle and Sally is working under the table !"
 ** Solved by: Not putting "that" before S (move it before VP)
               Moreover - only "and" can be between both: VP and NP

 > "is it true that I worked __that__ is working under Sally"
 ** This is related to the one above. "that" is very problematic:
    VP-NP  - "I thought that Sally is working"
    VPG-NP - "I am thinking that Sally is working"
    NP-NP  - "I kissed every pickle that Sally ate"
    NP-VP  - "I kissed Sally that worked under the table"
    VP-VPG - "he thought that working is bad "
    We decided to only allow [Verb that NP']

 > "it understood that she !"
 ** Solved:  [Verb that S]
